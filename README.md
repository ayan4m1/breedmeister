# Usage

Simply place a dispenser near two animals of the same type, add some wheat to
the dispenser, and power it with redstone current. A baby animal should appear
near one of the adults. The animals are only able to breed once every 5 minutes,
the same delay enforced when manually breeding.

# Configuration

At present, this plugin does not allow for any configuration. Breeding is only
allowed within 5 blocks of the dispenser and once every 5 minutes per involved
animal. One unit of wheat is consumed with each successful breeding.
